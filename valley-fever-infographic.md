Mesa Verde is located in the heart of a region that has high rates of
coccidioidomycosis cases, a disease also known as “cocci,” valley fever,
or death dust. For most, valley fever is a momentary illness, but for
some people, it can be life-threatening, requiring hospitalization or a
lifetime of medical treatment.

It’s enough of a public health concern for the California Department of
Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) to spend \$5 million to screen
inmates held in prisons in the Central Valley in response to federal
court supervision. The CDCR also moved more than 2,000 California
inmates from Central Valley prisons earlier this year because of the
health risks associated with valley fever.

Those at high risk for severe cases of valley fever include Black,
Hispanic, and Asian people--who, due to the systemic racism and
inequities in our criminal justice and immigration enforcement systems,
are also the ones most likely to be detained at Mesa Verde.

The situation is particularly troubling considering that many of the
future Mesa Verde detainees face deportation to countries where valley
fever does not exist or with medical systems that are ill-equipped to
treat it.
