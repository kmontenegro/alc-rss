Over the past year, community-led protests have spurred national outcry
against the violence and <span
style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">killing of
Black people by police. What are systemic solutions to address egregious
acts of state violence? This </span><span
style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">panel will
discuss a strategy of divestment from our punitive criminal justice
system, and reinvestment in </span><span
style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">education,
services, and restorative approaches.</span>

</p>

**July 23, 2015 (Thursday) at 12:00PM-1:00PM - <span

</p>

Presented by: <span
style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">David Ta
(VABANC Fellow, Advancing Justice-ALC); Winnie Kao (Litigation Director

Taxi, limo, and shared-ride companies have long relied on immigrant
drivers who are attracted by <span
style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">the
relatively low English-proficiency job requirements and the promises of
the “owner-operator” model. In </span><span
style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">reality,
however, many companies abuse drivers by misclassifying them as
independent contractors to avoid </span><span
style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">minimum
wage, overtime, and other workplace protections required by law for
employees. The emergence </span><span
style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">of new
on-demand, shared-economy companies like Uber, Lyft, and Sidecar have
made the industry </span><span
style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">intensively
competitive and exacerbated workplace abuses. This panel will explore
the changing dynamics in </span><span
style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">this
fast-evolving industry and the implications for all of us.</span>

</p>

**August 5, 2015 (Wednesday) at 12:00PM-1:00PM - <span
style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">Beyond
DACA: Highlighting Marginalized Undocumented API Stories</span>**

</p>

Presented by: <span
style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">ASPIRE
members</span>

This workshop is designed to foster better understanding of the
struggles that different Asian and <span
style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">Pacific
Islander community members face. Since the announcement of Deferred
Action for Childhood </span><span
style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">Arrivals,
we have seen the out pour of resources and support for direct services
and outreach. However, the </span><span
style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">challenges
that undocumented API families and communities face are not readily
resolved through the </span><span
style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">President’s
directive, even in its expansion. Many undocumented API families still
are ineligible for protection </span><span
style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">against
deportations and detention, while many others struggle to access basic
necessities such as healthcare. </span><span
style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">This brown
bag series will attempt to shed light on the human experiences that
surround the undocumented </span><span
style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">API
community and our struggle for respect and dignity through our
grassroots activism efforts.</span>
